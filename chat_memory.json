    "hello i am soya": "Hi Soya! Nice to meet you too. How can I help you today?",
    "nothing": "Okay, Soya.  Just let me know if you change your mind and need anything!  I'm here.",
    "how much quota i am left with?": "I don't have access to information about your quota or usage limits. I'm a large language model, and I don't track individual user data like that.  If you're using a service with usage limits, you'll need to check within that service's interface or documentation to find information about your remaining quota. Look for things like account settings, usage dashboards, or help pages.",
    "i am on free tier": "That's helpful to know!  Being on a free tier usually means there are some limits.  However, I still can't directly tell you how much of your free tier quota you have left.  You'll need to check the platform or service you're using.  Look for a usage dashboard or account settings page within that service. It's the best way to get accurate information about your specific usage.",
    "sigh such a shame": "I understand. It's always a little frustrating not having all the information readily available.  If you can tell me which service you're using, I might be able to give you more specific guidance on where to find your usage information.",
    "i am bored": "I understand. Boredom can be a drag.  What are you interested in? Maybe we can find something fun to do or talk about.  \n\nDo you like games, stories, trivia, learning new things, or something else entirely?  Let me know and we'll see what we can come up with!",
    "i love isekai": "Great! Isekai is a fun genre.  Do you have a favorite isekai anime, manga, light novel, or video game?  We could talk about some popular ones, discuss common tropes, or even brainstorm ideas for our own isekai story! What do you think?",
    "slime": "Ah, *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*!  A classic.  Do you have a favorite character? What do you enjoy most about the series: the world-building, the character development, the action sequences, or something else?  We could also talk about other slime-related isekai or similar series if you'd like."
